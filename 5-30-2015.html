<h1>Snowflake Devlog 5/30/2015 - Feature Showcase 1</h1>
<p>Snowflake has come a long way from a bunch of hacky Python scripts. 2 years since I started working on a frontend, I&#39;ve finally managed to build something that actually resembles one with C#, HTML5 and Javascript. Snowflake finally comes to a semblance of reality, an app that a person can actually use, and I&#39;m extremely excited to show it off.
Everything you see, and more will be available by <strong>July&#39;s alpha release.</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/66VDHTW.png" alt="screenshot">
If you&#39;ve been following Snowflake&#39;s development this screenshot should feel familiar. This Material Design theme will be Snowflake&#39;s very first theme, built to feel familiar and intuitive. Once I&#39;ve estalblished how everything fits together, <strong>I&#39;ll reuse parts of the code to build an XMB-like 10-foot interface.</strong> This screenshot just shows off the dynamic colour-schemes I have going on that determine the colours by the cover art. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve made some optimizations to this feature by caching the colours, so it only has to calculate the colours once; this resulted in a speedup of at least 10FPS during transitions going by Chrome&#39;s dev tools.</p>
<p><img src="http://fat.gfycat.com/FabulousEmptyDragon.gif" alt="flags"></p>
<p>One of Snowflake&#39;s most important features is setting emulator options inside the interface. When you make a change in setting to a certain game, it&#39;s marked <em>customized</em> for that game, unless you reset it to default. Every time you access the settings, any option not marked <em>customized</em> for a game will re-sync with the defaults. If you make a change to a default, those changes will propagate to every single game which doesn&#39;t have the option marked customized. </p>
<p>The system is remarkably simple. You can set an option, and the emulator plugin just flips a few switches, generates a configuration file and runs the emulator with the selected ROM. This will work with <em>any</em> emulator that uses configuration files.</p>

<p><img src="http://fat.gfycat.com/KeyTanFieldspaniel.gif" alt="controller-select"></p>
<p>You can also change controller settings inside Snowflake. How it works is, Snowflake stores a &quot;definition&quot; for a certain controller, that&#39;s linked to a certain platform â€” the <em>NES_CONTROLLER</em> is linked to the NES platform, etc. Then, for each controller, there&#39;s a profile that&#39;s linked with a certain input device. Usually the profile name is the same as the full device name, but for convinience, Snowflake gives the keyboard and 4 XInput controllers names that are easier remember than <code>Microsoft Xbox 360 Controller (for Windows)</code>.</p>
<p><img src="http://giant.gfycat.com/QuestionableWelltodoGrassspider.gif" alt="set-input">
Click the input you want to change, and a dialog will pop up. Press the new key you want, save your changes, and your controller setting for <strong>every emulator for that platform</strong> has been changed, just as if you were using a core in RetroArch. Except instead, we&#39;re just wrapping an EXE. And it&#39;s easier to use.</p>
<p><strong>What&#39;s left?</strong>
The cruicial parts I&#39;m missing right now are </p>
<ul>
<li>A way to set player 1, 2, 3, 4.</li>
<li>A way to change the default options for an emulator</li>
<li>Putting everything inside electron-shell instead of running it in Chrome.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two will be easy to implement. All I have to do is write the UI for that and hook it up to existing Javascript callbacks supplied by the C# core. The last part is the most important, but will be the most time-consuming to do. I need to be able to wrap everything up into one package, especially since having access to the filesystem is extremely important, which Chrome can&#39;t give me. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll be able to make #3 by July, so the alpha release won&#39;t be as polished as I&#39;d hoped. However, I&#39;m going to work on putting in all the features first before working on that.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also the issue of Polymer 1.0. I&#39;m currently using an old set of Polymer components that aren&#39;t foward compatible. I&#39;ll have to port everything over to the new version of Polymer once they&#39;ve ported all the elements in. I&#39;m expecting to do that after the alpha release in July.</p>
