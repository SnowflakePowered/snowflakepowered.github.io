title: New Website

I've built a new website based off Bootstrap and Jekyll for Snowflake. This new website looks a lot cleaner and is more informative than the old grey static one, and Jekyll lets me publish articles straight from the Markdown. The [docs](http://doxygen.doc.snowflakepowe.red/) are a lot more cleaner too, and use the same Bootstrap CSS.
