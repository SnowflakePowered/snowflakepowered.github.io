  <h1>Snowflake Developer Roundup - August 2015</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>There have been some major changes to the Snowflake API since I&#39;ve done a developer-oriented devlog. The good news is, now that all these big changes have been done, there aren&#39;t any more huge overhauls planned (except maybe the <a href="https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/snowflake/issues/142">removal of the entire IIdentifier API</a> ), so it is now safe to work with Snowflake&#39;s API to build and extend your frontend. <strong>The following is a wall of text that may be technical-sounding and regards the inner workings of Snowflake. Read on if you want to learn how to make plugins or themes</strong>. To get started with Snowflake,
you can get what you need to get set up at <a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/Snowflake">NuGet</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/snowflake.js">npm</a>. Offline documentation is available for download at <a href="https://ci.appveyor.com/project/RonnChyran/snowflake/build/artifacts">AppVeyor</a>.</p>

<h4>Make snowflake.js requests respond with useful objects</h4>

<p>For themers, [<a href="https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/snowflake/pull/132">PR #132</a>] makes <code>snowflake.setFlagValues</code> return all the new values, so you don&#39;t have to make an extra call to <code>snowflake.getFlagValues</code>. [<a href="https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/snowflake/pull/156">PR #156</a>] makes all JSAPI methods that used to return a status string return the object that was manipulated so you can use it right after. Unfortunately I still have to get on the documentation for <code>snowflake.js</code> and <code>Snowflake.StandardAjax</code>, so I apologize for that if you wanted to make a theme. You can look at <a href="https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/theme-paper-snowflake">theme-paper-snowflake</a> to see how to interact with the Snowflake JSAPI to make themes.</p>

<h4>C# 6.0 features</h4>

<p>Most importantly, [<a href="https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/snowflake/pull/154">PR #154</a>] upgrades Snowflake to use C# 6.0 features, as well as doing some code-cleanup. This means you will need <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx">Visual Studio 2015</a> to develop with Snowflake. Around the same time I&#39;ve also [<a href="https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/snowflake/pull/152">PR #152</a>] cleaned up and improved documentation. Documentation is now available in both <a href="https://ci.appveyor.com/project/RonnChyran/snowflake/build/artifacts">Sandcastle and Doxygen formats</a>. Doxygen provides some more information into the concrete implementations of some interfaces, but Sandcastle looks a lot more nicer.</p>

<h4>Proper entry point on Windows</h4>

<p>[<a href="https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/snowflake/pull/126">PR #126</a>] Introduces a proper entry-point on Windows rather than the hacky Core.Init. I&#39;m planning to extend this with a simple socket command interface (something basic like &quot;<code>SHUTDOWN</code>/<code>RESTART</code>/<code>INSTALLPLUGINS</code>&quot;) so the theme can communicate with it&#39;s host. Plugin installation will also be handled by the shell; plugins will be packaged in a simple ZIP compressed format with a manifest, and the shell will simply install whatever is placed into a staging folder.</p>

<h4>Flexible events framework</h4>

<p>One of the major overhauls in the API is with [<a href="https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/snowflake/pull/134">PR #134</a>] the events API. Rather than a set list of events that can&#39;t be extendable, the new Events API acts like a dependency-injection container. You register the event type with the <code>SnowflakeEventsManager.EventSource</code>, which persists indefinitely throughout the lifetime of the application, and you can raise and subscribe to the event as long as the plugin has knowledge of the EventArgs&#39;s Type. This makes it much more flexible and exposes a service for plugins to use.</p>

<h4>Better plugin utilities</h4>

<p>Speaking of plugins, [<a href="https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/snowflake/pull/128">PR #128</a>] and [<a href="https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/snowflake/pull/147">PR #147</a>] introduce new utility features for plugins to use. Plugins can now clean up on unload by overriding <code>Dispose()</code> as per .NET conventions, and access a logger object at <code>this.Logger</code>. <code>IPluginConfigurationOption</code> hasn&#39;t been implemented yet, but will be a way for themes to access and change plugin options, basically a shim for an <code>IPluginConfiguration</code> object.</p>

<h4>EmulatorBridge improvements</h4>

<p>There are a lot of breaking changes that involve <code>IEmulatorBridge</code>, in order to make writing bridges and adapters much easier. <a href="sorry%20for%20the%20messy%20commit%20history"><a href="https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/snowflake/pull/149">PR #149</a></a> splits off super-long single time templates into their own files, because JSON doesn&#39;t like multi-line strings. I find this is much more easier to work with rather than having strings with <code>\r\n</code> scattered literally everywhere, simply name the template the same as the configuration ID, and save it as an embedded resource. Most importantly, [<a href="https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/snowflake/pull/159">PR #159</a>] inserts the <code>IGameInfo</code> game object into all the <code>CompileConfiguration</code> and <code>CompileController</code> overloads. This allows plugins to conditionally compile configuration files based on the game and the game&#39;s flags. This allows things like selecting which <a href="https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/emulator-DolphinBridge/blob/master/DolphinBridge.Stable.Five/resource/flags.json#L3">Wii Remote extension to use</a> by a configuration flag.</p>

<h4>Controller compilation improvements</h4>

<p>[<a href="https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/snowflake/pull/144">PR #144</a>] adds mouse support to <code>IKeyboardMapping</code>, so any <code>input.json</code> files will have to be updated to accommodate the new <code>MOUSE_*</code> keys. [<a href="https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/snowflake/pull/121">PR #121</a>] greatly simplifies controller compilation. Instead of having to map each profile to a controller definition, and to a device, <code>GamepadAbstraction</code> provides a RetroArch or HTML5-like model of a unified virtual gamepad modeled on an XInput controller. Instead of getting the profile for the controller for the device, you can simply get the <code>GamepadAbstraction</code> for the device, and everything is automatically <a href="https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/snowflake-controllers">mapped together by the controller definition</a>.</p>

<h4>Getting Started</h4>

<p>You can get what you need to get set up at <a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/Snowflake">NuGet</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/snowflake.js">npm</a>. Offline documentation is available for download at <a href="https://ci.appveyor.com/project/RonnChyran/snowflake/build/artifacts">AppVeyor</a>. To reiterate, the Plugin, Events and StandardAjax (snowflake.js) APIs are essentially stable now and won&#39;t have any more breaking changes  unless something big happens, but please do be aware that Snowflake is still technically in code-churn so do look out for any breaking PRs that are to be merged by starring the <a href="https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/snowflake">GitHub page</a>. If you need any help with understanding the API, contact me through <a href="reddit.com/u/ron975">reddit</a> or by email at <a href="mailto:ronny@ronnchyran.com">ronny@ronnchyran.com</a>.</p>
