  <h1>Snowflake Progress Report - August 2015</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>First off, apologies for the delay in releasing the alpha preview. Originally, I planned to release earlier, but as I went on, I felt Snowflake is still not ready for use. I want to deliver you the best frontend ever, even in alpha. Only recently were some features added, and there still aren&#39;t enough emulators that have had plugins written, which is taking more time than anticipated. The main theme still has a few bugs and unimplemented features, and overall it&#39;s lacking in polish that would&#39;ve been great for a preview. That doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t see what I&#39;ve been up to these past months though!</p>

<p>You can contact through <a href="http://reddit.com/u/ron975">reddit</a> or by email at <a href="mailto:ronny@ronnchyran.com">ronny@ronnchyran.com</a>. Without further ado, let&#39;s take a look at some new features since the last showcase.</p>

<h2>Better settings</h2>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/qgVGi2U.gif" alt="Better Settings"></p>

<p>Changing settings has been improved greatly. The previous &quot;Customized&quot; system has been completely overhauled to be more explicit with a locked (set to default settings) and unlocked (customizable) system.  Loading and syncing settings has also been optimized, it now loads and refreshes twice as fast, and doesn&#39;t randomly lose customized settings anymore as it did before.</p>

<h2>One device, one gamepad</h2>

<p>Snowflake used to require every single device be separate in terms of mapping controls. This would&#39;ve meant having to set different button mappings for every controller, for every device. You would be setting the &#39;A&#39; button fifteen times just so you could play <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> and <em>Sonic &amp; Knuckles</em> the same way.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/MIEOg9e.png" alt="Simple Control"></p>

<p>This feature has been reworked to use a system more similar to RetroArch&#39;s. For every input device there is only one set of mappings to a &quot;virtual&quot; gamepad that is worked down the each emulator&#39;s controls. The A button is now the same button across the Genesis, the PlayStation (err.. <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/PlayStationX.svg" alt="Cross"> button), and the Gamecube.</p>

<h2>PLAYER ONE &mdash; Insert Controller</h2>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/jOi3bVa.png" alt="Port Settings"></p>

<p>You can choose which device you want to use for which player, just like an actual console. <small><del>Now you can beat Psycho Mantis</del></small> For now, Snowflake works only with the keyboard/mouse and XInput controllers. Support for DirectInput and udev (Linux) will come soon after the alpha.</p>

<h2>More and more emulators</h2>

<p>The most important part of an emulator frontend is the emulators. Many more emulators have already been adapted to Snowflake&#39;s powerful plugin system, like <a href="https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/emulator-RetroArchBridge">Mednafen PSX and Genesis Plus GX</a>. A Dolphin plugin is <a href="https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/emulator-DolphinBridge">already coming together</a>. Snowflake&#39;s plugin system is extremely flexible; the Dolphin plugin will detect whether or not you have Wii remotes plugged in and automatically override any emulated Wiimotes.</p>

<h2>Spiffy installer</h2>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/IMsdNxZ.gif" alt="installer">
Snowflake is going to be easy to install. When you first start it up, Snowflake will grab a list of plugins from a plugin repository and automatically download and install them. We&#39;re still working on the downloading part (the alpha will have to come with all plugins pre-installed), but Snowflake makes both the first setup, and keeping up to date, extremely easy.</p>

<h2>More to come</h2>

<p>We&#39;re quickly approaching Snowflake 1.0 Alpha. The dream I&#39;ve had for <a href="https://github.com/RonnChyran/Snowflake-old">2+ years</a> and <a href="https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/snowflake-py">3 rewrites</a> is finally coming to fruition, but it&#39;s not done yet. I have big plans in mind, including cloud saves, automatic CUE generation for PSX games and a 10-foot theme based on <a href="http://www.lakka.tv/">Lakka.tv</a>. If you have any more ideas or features you want to see in Snowflake, feel free to contact me through <a href="http://reddit.com/u/ron975">reddit</a> or by email at <a href="mailto:ronny@ronnchyran.com">ronny@ronnchyran.com</a>. I can&#39;t wait to see what I can show off by the Alpha.</p>
